# ZeroApp
Read the READ_ME in each project first.

## How to start
- Create your branch first, please don't make change directly to the main branch.
- For each project (application, data_access, web_app), there is a READ_ME file for dependencies set up, let me know if there is any problem

## Naming convention
- For python projects (application, data_access), please use PEP 8 convention.
- For Javascript projects, please use camelCase for folders and files name.
